### ðŸ”“ License Change

The project will become open-source under the following conditions:

- **If Arphros development is inactive for 2 consecutive years**, **or**
- **If total lifetime revenue exceeds $1000 USD** and the project continues to receive active support for at least 6 months thereafter

When this happens, the code will be **relicensed**:

- **By default, under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)**
- However, the original developer [**Rhitomaic**](https://github.com/ReDarkTechnology) reserves the right to relicense it under either the [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or the [GNU GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) instead, based on what best serves the project and its contributors at that time.

All changes will apply retroactively to the codebase and will be announced publicly.

---

We aim to make Arphros fully open-source once the project is sustainable and stable for long-term community development.
